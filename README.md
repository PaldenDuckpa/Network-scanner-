# MasterQ 1.0 - Cybersecurity Toolkit

MasterQ 1.0 is a Python-based cybersecurity toolkit designed to provide various network scanning, packet sniffing, vulnerability scanning, traffic monitoring, and wireless analysis capabilities. It's structured to be modular, allowing for easy extension and maintenance of tools.

## Features

* **Network Scanning (Nmap):** Discover hosts and services on a network.
* **Packet Sniffing (Tcpdump, Scapy):** Capture and analyze network traffic.
* **Vulnerability Scanning (Nikto):** Identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
* **Traffic Monitoring (Snort):** Monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
* **Wireless Tools (Airodump-ng):** Capture and analyze wireless packets.

## Directory Structure
Okay, Vimal, I understand. You'd like me to generate a README.md file specifically tailored for your "MasterQ" tool, based on the code and documentation you've provided. I'll create a comprehensive README that explains the purpose of the tool, how to use it, and provides relevant information for users on GitHub.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* `scapy`
* `nmap` (Python library)
* `Nikto`
* `Snort`
* `Airodump-ng`
* Other dependencies as required by individual tools.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd MasterQ
    ```

2.  Install Python dependencies (if any):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Ensure that the necessary tools (Nmap, Nikto, Snort, Airodump-ng) are installed on your system.

## Configuration

MasterQ uses a `config.yaml` file to store configuration settings. You can modify this file to customize tool paths and other options.

## Usage

MasterQ is a command-line tool. The basic syntax is:

```bash
python3 masterQ_1.0.py <tool> [options]

Available Tools and Examples
1. Scan Network with Nmap
Bash

python3 masterQ_1.0.py scan-network <target>

    <target>: The target IP address or network (e.g., 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.0/24).

2. Run Nikto Scan
Bash

python3 masterQ_1.0.py run-exploit <target_url>

    <target_url>: The URL of the web application to scan (e.g., http://example.com).

3. Start Snort IDS
Bash

python3 masterQ_1.0.py start-ids <interface>

    <interface>: The network interface to monitor (e.g., eth0).

4. Run Airodump-ng
Bash

python3 masterQ_1.0.py run-wireless <interface>

    <interface>: The wireless interface to capture packets on (e.g., wlan0).

5. Packet Sniffing

    This functionality might be within packet_sniffers.py and could be called directly or via a specific command if you add one to masterQ_1.0.py. If it's direct, provide an example of how to run the script.

Viewing Documentation

To view detailed documentation for specific tools (e.g., Nmap, Snort):
Bash

python3 masterQ_1.0.py docs <tool_name>

    <tool_name>: The name of the tool (e.g., nmap, snort).

Modules

The tools are organized into the following modules:

    packet_sniffers.py: Contains packet sniffing tools (Tcpdump, Scapy).
    network_scanners.py: Contains network scanning tools (Nmap).
    vulnerability_scanners.py: Contains vulnerability scanning tools (Nikto).
    traffic_monitoring.py: Contains traffic monitoring tools (Snort).
    wireless_tools.py: Contains wireless analysis tools (Airodump-ng).

Documentation

Detailed documentation for some tools is available in the docs/ directory.
